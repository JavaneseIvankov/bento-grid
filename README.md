## My process

- Setting up CSS Styles Boilerplates (colors, fonts, reset),
- Reading docs and searching about the best layout for this use case.
- HTML Structure
- Styling (Desktop View)
- Styling + Added Responsiveness (Mobile View)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

#### General

- Dealing with grid layout,
- How to use relative sizing like vw, vh, and percent,
- When to use relative sizing vs px,
- Organizing CSS in a more semantic-grouped manner.

#### Detailed

- Grid layout allows you to use percent as gap, whereas flexbox do not.
- Padding matters a lot in styling, if not use carefully, it'll make your life a much harder.

### Continued development

- I am curious wheter it's possible to achieve same results purely with auto-gridand / or flexbox.
